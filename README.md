# BLUX-cA

**The BLUX Coding Agent**  
_Modular. Local-first. Community-powered._

---

## 🚧 Project Status: Planning & Scaffolding 🚧

This repository is the future home of **BLUX-cA** (“Coding Agent”)—the modular, open-source, local-first AI coding assistant designed for every device.

---

## **What is BLUX-cA?**

BLUX-cA is the central “hive mind” coding agent in the [BLUX](https://github.com/Justadudeinspace/blux) ecosystem.  
It aims to provide:

- **Local-first AI** (runs on your hardware, not the cloud)
- **Pluggable agent system** (easily add or remove AI models, code helpers, search, and creative tools)
- **Privacy & ethics first** (user data never leaves your device by default)
- **Cross-platform** (Android, Linux, Windows, more—by design)
- **Community-driven** (built to be hacked, forked, extended)

---

## **Why BLUX-cA?**

- No more paywalls or locked-in cloud AI—**own your tools**
- Complete modularity: swap models, plugins, and workflows
- Designed for devs, students, tinkerers, and creative builders

---

## **Planned Features**

- 🧠 AI-powered code writing, search, and automation
- 🔌 Modular plugin/agent framework (code, search, creative, more)
- 🔒 User-controlled memory & context (local or cloud, never forced)
- 💾 Flexible storage: use device, SD, or user-owned cloud (MEGA S4, GDrive, more)
- 🖥️ CLI, TUI, and future GUI options
- ⚡ Community package and agent hub

> About BLUX-cA Local Memory
BLUX-cA leverages the Liberation Framework to deliver truly user-defined, persistent memory.
All context is saved and restored using simple, transparent .libf files—nothing is ever stored without your knowledge or consent.
This system embodies the BLUX commitment to privacy, modularity, and user agency.

## **Roadmap**

1. **Initial scaffolding & codebase setup**
2. Core CLI and config modules
3. Engine wrappers for open-source LLMs
4. Agent/plugin loader framework
5. Sample agent modules and memory integration
6. Documentation, quickstart, and contributor guides
